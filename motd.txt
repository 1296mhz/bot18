                          Working on the trading engine!

    Hey guys,

    I'm doing some major refactoring on the engine, making it "multi-threaded"
    by having a single supervisor process, which manages the strategy, and
    controls an army of sub-processes for each task/exchange/asset combo you
    want to trade. Things are going well but the scope is expanding quickly.

    I hope to have a testable Bot18 client/engine by next week, and if I do,
    I'll officially start the Beta, send an announcement email out, and anyone
    with an Unlock Code will be able to run the most up-to-date build.

    The client/engine will not be very close to finished when the Beta starts,
    so expect some unstability and it may go through several re-codes before
    the Beta is over.

    Also, I plan on doing a full re-design of bot18.net, making it more "trustable"
    as a brand, and I'm purchasing Zalgo.net, for expanding later as a cloud
    service and social network.
