                        Welcome to the Bot18 Public Beta!


    Bot18 is "online" software, designed to be invoked without installing.
    The only pre-requisite is having Node.js >= 8.3.0 installed.
    The recommended way to launch is with:

    For configuration options, see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bot18

    Beta Features (So far)

    The current version is an early proof-of-concept, and supports:

      - Monitoring live trade and orderbook streams from Bitfinex
          and Coinbase Pro simultaneously.
      - Coinbase Pro (formerly known as GDAX) live trading.
      - Tracks your account balance and reports profit/loss when you trade.
      - Press the "l" key to list available key commands.
      - Supports executing manual trades when yellow "M" is displayed
          at the end of the console columns.
      - Enter "A" (capitalized) to enable auto-trading.
      - The early auto-trading strategy is based on orderbook snapshot
          power-imbalance, and is highly experimental. Currently, the
          Beta's auto-trading strategy is not recommended for serious trading.
